# Exercise 3

For this exercise, work on the file `lib/learndart.dart`.

Everytime the button is pushed, print the numbers from 0 to `counter`, but to not print the numbers divisible by 5.

Tips

- Use a loop to print something repeatedly until a certain condition is met
- Start by printing all numbers, exclude the numbers divisible by 5 later
