# Exercise 2

For this exercise, work on the file `lib/learndart.dart`.

Print "*You pushed the button less than 4 times*", "*You pushed the button more than 3 times*" and "*You pushed the button too much!*" according to the meaning.

Tips

- Use if-else statements to check if the value of `counter` respects a condition
- "*too much*" is not defined, choose your own
- Do you need to change the value of `initialMessage`?
